AnchorPy is the gateway to interacting with [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) programs in Python.
It provides a static client generator, a dynamic client similar to `anchor-ts`, a Pytest plugin and a CLI with various
utilities for Anchor Python development.

## Installation (requires Python >= 3.9)

```shell
pip install anchorpy[cli]
```


!!! note
    These docs will assume you've read the [Anchor documentation](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-0.html) first.
