# Changelog

## [0.4.2] - 2021-11-20

- Dedupe transaction signers
## [0.4.1] - 2021-11-20

### Fixed

## [0.4.0] - 2021-11-20

### Changed

- BREAKING: Some program namespace entries are now snake-case (https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/13).
This affects `program.rpc`, `program.instruction`, fields inside `program.type` entries, and 
the `accounts` argument to `Context`.
- BREAKING: `instructions` is replaced with `pre_instructions` and `post_instructions`. (https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/18)
- BREAKING: User-defined types must now be constructed using the new `program.type` namespace. https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/7 This also affects the return type of `.fetch` - the returned object is now a dataclass and requires `.` access instead of `[]`.
- BREAKING: `provider.client` is renamed to `provider.connection`.
- Refactor `.send` to use more `solana-py` functionality. https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/11
