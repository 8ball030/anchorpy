- BREAKING: User-defined types must now be constructed using the new `program.type` namespace. https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/7 This also affects the return type of `.fetch` - the returned object is now a dataclass and requires `.` access instead of `[]`.
- BREAKING: `provider.client` is renamed to `provider.connection`.
- Refactor `.send` to use more `solana-py` functionality. https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy/pull/11
